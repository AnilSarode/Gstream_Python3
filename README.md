This repository contains tutorials for Gstreamer, which can be found at https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/index.html?gi-language=c.

I have endeavored to provide Python3 equivalent code for the C code presented in the tutorials, along with solutions for the exercises mentioned, both in C and Python3.
